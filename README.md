# 💻 Challenge Solve The X | Frontend
This project has been carried out as a result of a challenge proposed by "Solve the X". The project consists of a frontend with Vue and a backend with Node and Express. This repository corresponds to the frontend. The backend is in [this repository](https://github.com/radikalex/challengeSolveTheX-backend).

## 🦾 Used technology 
- Vue 3
- Typescript
- Pinia
- Vite
- Flowbite (Tailwind)
- Axios

# 📋 Pre requirements

0 - You need to have Node installed on your computer.

1 - In order to start the project first make a git clone of this project.

2 - Once the project is cloned, you must install the necessary modules with npm:
> npm install

3 - At this time the backend server should be up and with the seeders on. 
If the backend server is not up, the frontend will not work as it should.

4 - You need to start the front end server with the following command
> npm run dev

## 📜 Comments about the project

- Some Vue Router Navigation Guards have been implemented. This makes it impossible to access certain tabs without being authenticated.
- The design was not important for this project so a simple one has been made.
- If you have used the backend seeders you should be able to login as admin using "admin@gmail.com" as email and "admin" as password.
- If you are logged in as admin, a button appears next to your name in the navigation bar to go to the administrator view.
